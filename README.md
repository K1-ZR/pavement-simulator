# What is Pavement-Simulator?
Fatigue cracking of the surface layer of a pavements structure is a common distress that reduces the service life of pavement drastically. Accurate prediction of crack propagation in pavement surface layer requires to consider the role of underneath layers. Pavement-Simulator simulates crack propagation in overlay layer while it takes into account the key features of a pavement structure:  
* Time-dependent behavior of layers  
* Bonding condition between layers  
* Presence of distressed layer or existing joint  

Pavement-Simulator creates a simplified 2D FE model of the real problem without losing the key features.
