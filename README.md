# What is Pavement-Simulator
Fatigue cracking is a common distress in pavments that reducesses its service life drastically. Crack growth in pavements is highly affected by pavement structure. Pavement-Simulator simulates crack propagation in overlay layer as it takes into account the key features of a pavement structure:  
* Time dependant behavior of layers  
* Bonding condition between layers  
* Presence of distresed layer or existing joint
