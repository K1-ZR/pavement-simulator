# What is Pavement-Simulator
Fatigue cracking of the surface layer of a pavements structure is a common distress that reducesses the service life of pavement drastically. Accurate prediction of crack propagation in pavement surface layer requires to consider the role of underneath layers. Pavement-Simulator simulates crack propagation in overlay layer while it takes into account the key features of a pavement structure:  
* Time dependant behavior of layers  
* Bonding condition between layers  
* Presence of distresed layer or existing joint

Pavement-Simulator creates a simplfied 2D FE model of the real problem without losing the key features.
